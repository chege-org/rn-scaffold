# React Native Scaffold
Welcome to the React Native Scaffold! 

This scaffold is designed to help you quickly and easily set up a new React Native project. With this scaffold, you can start building your React Native application with ease, without having to worry about the initial setup and configuration.

## How to use
To use this scaffold, you'll need to have [Cookiecutter](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installation.html#install-cookiecutter) installed on your system. Once you have Cookiecutter installed, follow these steps:

Open a terminal window on your local machine and navigate to the directory where you want to create your new React Native project.

Once you're in the correct directory, enter the following command:

```bash
cookiecutter gh:james-chege/rn-scaffold
```
This command tells Cookiecutter to use this rn-scaffold repository as the template for your new project.

Follow the prompts to enter the name of your project. The scaffold will generate a new React Native project with the name you provided.

Once the scaffold has finished generating your project, navigate into the project directory and follow the instructions in the [<project_name>/Readme]({{cookiecutter.project_slug}}/README.md)
to get started with your project

### Here's what's included in the scaffold:

- A clean and organized project structure
- Preconfigured eslint and prettier for consistent code formatting
- A basic configuration for React Navigation
- Jest for testing
- Preconfigured React native web
